I chose the URL-shortener project because at the time, I was not nearly as confident in my coding or design abilities as I am now.

The most interesting part of this experience is seeing how all of the concepts we learned in class came together in one project; the considerations for mobile-first design, working with css, and working with flexbox were the areas in which I spent the most time. 

I don't see myself seeking roles where I will focus on front-end design, but I know I'll be able to collaborate with front-end designers due because I've learned terminolgy to bridge the design/functionality gap. I now have a greater appreciation for those that can build pixel-perfect websites from mockups.

About the code, I was fortunate that bitly worked as expected once I knew how to use the API. I'm now aware of the basic syntax of any API call, and I'm not so intimidated by the sheer volume of data stored in public dummy databses.
